You have just being newly employed as a cloud engr level 1,You have the following task

1.Using a single node  minikube cluster or any kubernetes cluster of your choice

Create a pod named web-pod
with image: ngnix
Namesapace: dev
.Expose the pod on port:80
Make sure the pod is not running meaning you a do a dry run and output the yaml file on pod.yaml.

2. Now create (apply the file using this pod.yaml file.
3. Check the status of the pod, troubleshoot and correct the issues with the pod and reconfigure appropriately stating your troubleshooting processes to resolving the issues
4. If and when the issues are resolved ,you must exec into the pod to show what's inside the pod but make sure the pod is running

Hint:
alias k=kubectl
export do="- - dry-run=client -o yaml"

## Steps to deploy this project
With minikube already installed on your local machine run

minikube start
alias k=kubectl
export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
k create namespace dev
k run web-pod --image=ngnix --port=80 -n dev $do > pod.yaml (This will not create the pod yet ‚Äî it just generates the YAML file)
k apply -f pod.yaml
k get pods -n dev
k describe pod web-pod -n dev
# Fix pod.yaml (change ngnix -> nginx)
k delete -f pod.yaml
k apply -f pod.yaml
k get pods -n dev
k exec -it web-pod -n dev -- sh

Once you,ve successfully exec into the pod do "ls" to know what is inside the pod
Next, you exit

  ## SOLUTION
  change the image name to nginx
## Note once u initialize the change in your pod.yaml 
delete ehe existing pod before creating another one
secondly when you,ve created the pod if your 
k get pods is showing containercreating dont panic give it a little time mine took 8mins before the pod started running.
